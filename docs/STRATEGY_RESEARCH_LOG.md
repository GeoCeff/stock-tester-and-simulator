## 2026-07-25 — Real-data baseline and evidence correction

- Scope: 20 liquid US stocks, eight years of Yahoo Finance daily bars, five walk-forward folds, and 10 bps cost per side.
- Worked in development: `SWING_20D / trend_momentum` passed both signal and exact bracket-plan validation.
- Failed untouched holdout: signal expectancy -0.0755%, profit factor 0.966; exact plan expectancy -0.0414%, profit factor 0.986. No strategy was enabled and no entry was published.
- Failed development: a literature-inspired 12-month momentum variant did not meet profit-factor and drawdown gates. It was rejected without touching the final holdout.
- Forward evidence: zero closed trades for the current exact plan, so live execution remains blocked.
- Correction: internal development-validation results are no longer labeled as final holdout results. Among development-pass candidates, selection now uses executable bracket-plan evidence rather than signal score alone.

Decision: keep researching and paper trading; do not weaken gates or claim a consistently winning strategy.

Reference: [Time Series Momentum](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2089463) motivates the rejected 12-month development experiment but does not validate this individual-stock implementation.
